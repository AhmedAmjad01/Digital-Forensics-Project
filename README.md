# Digital-Forensics-Project
This project investigates an insider data breach at HaajiZ Corp, where an employee used PowerShell, fileless malware, and a keylogger to exfiltrate sensitive data. Using storage, memory, and network forensics, the investigation aims to uncover digital evidence, trace the attack timeline, and recommend preventive security measures.
