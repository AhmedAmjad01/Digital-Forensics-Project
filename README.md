## üß™ Methodology

### Phase 1: Evidence Collection
- Clone hard drives, extract memory dumps, and collect PCAP network logs.

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
- **Autopsy/Sleuth Kit**: Recover deleted files, analyze USB usage.
- **Volatility**: Identify injected processes, credential harvesting, keylogger traces.
- **Wireshark/Zeek**: Analyze data exfiltration (e.g., DNS tunneling, cloud uploads).

### Phase 3: Reporting & Recommendations
- Document evidence and timeline.
- Recommend controls (USB restrictions, PowerShell monitoring, IDS, etc.).
- Deliver final forensic report and presentation.

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcomes
- Proven insider threat activity through digital artifacts.
- Evidence of malware and keylogger deployment.
- Traced exfiltration vectors (DNS tunneling, cloud services).
- A comprehensive report with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and recommendations.
